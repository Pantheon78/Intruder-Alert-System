Intruder Alert System ðŸš¨

Description

This is a motion-detection intruder alert system built using a Raspberry Pi Pico, PIR sensor, LED, and buzzer. The system is programmed in MicroPython and simulated in Wokwi.

      Features
 Detects motion using a PIR sensor
 Activates an LED and buzzer when motion is detected
 Written in MicroPython
 Simulated using Wokwi

     Components Used
Raspberry Pi Pico
PIR Motion Sensor
LED
Buzzer
Resistors & Jumper Wires

     How It Works

The PIR sensor detects motion.
If motion is detected, the system: 
Turns on the LED
Activates the buzzer to alert users
If no motion is detected, the LED and buzzer remain off

     Code To Project
from machine import Pin ,PWM
import time 

PIR_Sensor = Pin(26, Pin.IN)
LED     = Pin(4 , Pin.OUT)
Buzzer = PWM(Pin(12))


while True:
    if PIR_Sensor.value() == 1:
        print ("Motion Detected")
        LED.value(1)
        Buzzer.freq(1000)
        Buzzer.duty_u16(30000)
        time.sleep(2)

    else:
        LED.value(0)
        Buzzer.duty_u16(0)
        time.sleep(2)
